                    <h3 class="author">by H.P Lovecraft</h3>
                    <p class="reviewParagraph">The Colour Out of Space" is a chilling and atmospheric tale by HP Lovecraft, first 
                        published in 1927. The story follows the events surrounding a meteorite that crashes
                         on the property of the fictional town of Arkham, Massachusetts, and the strange 
                         and terrifying effects it has on the land and its inhabitants. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="reviewParagraph">The story is narrated by an unnamed surveyor who is sent to the area to investigate 
                        the strange occurrences that have been reported by the locals. He meets with the 
                        Gardner family, who have been the most affected by the meteorite's arrival. The 
                        patriarch, Nahum, tells the surveyor about how the meteorite landed on his land 
                        and how it seems to have drained the life out of everything around it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="reviewParagraph">
                        As the story progresses, it becomes clear that the meteorite is not just a regular 
                        space rock but is instead an extraterrestrial entity that has a profound effect on 
                        the land and life around it. The strange and otherworldly color that emanates from 
                        it seems to have a corrupting influence on everything it touches, leading to bizarre 
                        and horrifying mutations in plants, animals, and even the humans living nearby.
                    </p>
                    <p class="reviewParagraph">
                        Lovecraft's writing style is highly descriptive and evocative, making it easy to imagine 
                        the desolate and eerie landscape that the surveyor encounters. He uses a lot of 
                        scientific jargon to describe the effects of the meteorite, which adds a layer of 
                        plausibility to the story, even as the events become increasingly surreal.

                    </p>
                    <p class="reviewParagraph"> 
                         The horror in "The Colour Out of Space" is not of the jump-scare variety but is instead a
                         slow-burning and insidious kind of dread. Lovecraft's use of cosmic horror is on full 
                         display here, as the otherworldly entity that is the meteorite is so far beyond human 
                         understanding that it is impossible to comprehend or even describe fully.

                    </p>
                    <p class="reviewParagraph">
                        The story is also notable for its themes of isolation and decay. The Gardner family, who 
                        were once a thriving and happy community, are slowly but surely destroyed by the effects 
                        of the meteorite. Lovecraft seems to be suggesting that even the most stable and seemingly 
                        secure communities can be undone by outside forces beyond their control.

                    </p>
                    <p class="reviewParagraph">
                        One criticism of the story is that the characters are somewhat flat and undeveloped, serving
                         mainly as vessels for the horror and strangeness of the events around them. However, this is 
                         a common feature of Lovecraft's writing, and it is the eerie atmosphere and sense of impending
                          doom that are the true stars of the show.

                    </p>
                    <p class="reviewParagraph">
                        Overall, "The Colour Out of Space" is a classic tale of cosmic horror that is sure to unsettle 
                        and disturb even the most seasoned horror fans. Lovecraft's evocative writing style and the slowly
                         unfolding horror make for an engaging and memorable read that will stick with readers long after 
                         they finish the story.
